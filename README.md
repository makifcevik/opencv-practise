# OPENCV PRACTISE
In this project, I aimed to practise the basics of opencv which I've just started learning.

## Things I've learned so far:
- Basic image manipulation with numpy arrays
- Displaying videos by loading or through webcam.
- Image/video resizing, rotating, copying and pasting some parts
- Drawing basic lines/shapes/text
- Color detection, masking
- Corner detection
- Object matching
