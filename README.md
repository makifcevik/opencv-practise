# OpenCV Practice

This repository serves as a learning playground for OpenCV, where I explore and practice various fundamental concepts.

## What I've Explored:

- **Basic Image Manipulation:** Utilizing NumPy arrays for essential image operations.
- **Video Display:** Loading videos and streaming from a webcam.
- **Transformation Operations:** Resizing, rotating, copying, and pasting image/video regions.
- **Drawing on Images:** Creating lines, shapes, and text on images.
- **Color Manipulation:** Detection and masking based on color.
- **Corner Detection:** Identifying corners in images.
- **Object Matching:** Locating objects within images.
- **Face Detection:** Detecting faces in images.
- **Eye Detection:** Identifying eyes within faces.
